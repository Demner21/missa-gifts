### No Duplicate Instructions per Participant

**Requirement**

* Each participant must receive **only one unique instruction** during the Instructions Phase.
* **Duplicate instructions for the same participant must be avoided**.

**Behavior**

* When assigning an instruction:

  * The system must select **only from the remaining (unused) instructions**.
  * Once an instruction is assigned to a participant, it must be **removed from the available instructions pool**.
* An instruction **cannot be reassigned** to another participant unless repetition is explicitly enabled (out of scope by default).

**Constraints**

* The instruction pool must shrink as instructions are assigned.
* If the number of participants exceeds the number of available instructions:

  * The system should prevent further assignment, or
  * Clearly notify that there are no remaining instructions available.

**UX Considerations**

* Optionally display the **remaining instruction count**.
* Disable the **“Assign Instruction”** button when no instructions are left.

**Design Goal**

* Ensure clarity, fairness, and simplicity by guaranteeing that:

  * One participant → one instruction
  * No instruction repetition during a single Instructions Phase
