### Instructions Phase – Simplified Logic & UI Adjustments

**Clarification**

* It is **not required to track or determine the final gift ownership** for each participant after all instructions are applied.
* The main purpose of the Instructions Phase is to **create fun and chaos** by disturbing the original gift assignments, not to compute a final, optimized result.

**Logic Simplification**

* During the Instructions Phase:

  * Instructions may temporarily change, swap, or move gifts between participants.
  * The system does **not need to store or calculate a final “who ends up with which gift” state**.
  * The focus is on **executing and visualizing each instruction step**, rather than the final outcome.
* This simplification is intended to:

  * Reduce implementation complexity.
  * Keep the experience playful and dynamic.

**UI / UX Adjustments**

* Once the application transitions into the **Instructions Phase**:

  * The **Participants list** layout must be hidden.
  * The **Remaining Gifts** layout must be hidden.
* Only UI elements relevant to the Instructions Phase should be visible, such as:

  * Current participant receiving an instruction.
  * The instruction being applied.
  * Visual feedback of the gift movement or swap.

**User Experience Goal**

* The Instructions Phase should feel like a **live, entertaining sequence**, where:

  * Each instruction adds surprise.
  * Users focus on *what is happening now*, not on tracking final results.

**Optional Enhancements**

* Provide a clear **“Instructions Phase” banner or title** when entering this mode.
* Add subtle transitions when layouts are hidden or shown to maintain visual continuity.
