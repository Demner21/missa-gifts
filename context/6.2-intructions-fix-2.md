### Random Instruction Assignment

**Requirement**

* Instructions must be assigned **randomly**, not sequentially.
* The application must **not** assign instructions starting from the first item in the instructions list and continuing in order.

**Behavior**

* When the user clicks the **“Assign Instruction”** button:

  * One instruction must be **randomly selected** from the pool of available instructions.
  * The selection must be **fair and unbiased**.
* Once an instruction is assigned:

  * It may be removed from the available instructions pool (to avoid repetition), or
  * It may remain available if repetition is intentionally allowed (configurable behavior).

**Constraints**

* Random instruction selection must be **independent** of:

  * The participant draw order.
  * The original order of instructions in the JSON file.

**UX Considerations**

* Clearly display that the instruction was **randomly selected** (e.g., shuffle animation or indicator).
* Disable the **“Assign Instruction”** button while the instruction selection animation is running (if any).

**Optional Enhancements**

* Allow configuration to:

  * Enable or disable instruction repetition.
  * Set a maximum number of times an instruction can be reused.
