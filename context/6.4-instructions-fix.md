### Dynamic Instruction Assignment (Roulette-Style)

**Requirement**

* The process of assigning an instruction must be **dynamic and exciting**, rather than an instant random selection.
* When the user clicks the **“Assign Instruction”** button, the application must display a **roulette-style animation** that cycles through the remaining instructions.

**Behavior**

* The roulette must:

  * Display **only the remaining (unused) instructions**.
  * Visually cycle through instruction texts while spinning.
  * Gradually slow down before stopping on the selected instruction.
* Once the roulette stops:

  * The selected instruction is assigned to the current participant.
  * The instruction is removed from the available instructions pool.
* The final instruction selection must remain **fair and random**, with the animation acting as a visual enhancement only.

**Constraints**

* Instructions already assigned must **never appear** in the roulette.
* Instruction selection must respect the **no-duplicate-instructions** rule.

**UX Considerations**

* Disable the **“Assign Instruction”** button while the roulette animation is running.
* Clearly display:

  * The current participant.
  * The selected instruction.
* Optionally add:

  * Sound effects or subtle vibration cues.
  * Visual emphasis (highlight, scale, glow) on the final instruction.

**User Experience Goal**

* Each instruction assignment should feel like a **mini-event**, maintaining attention and excitement throughout the Instructions Phase.

**Optional Enhancements**

* Configurable spin duration.
* Different animation styles for instructions vs gift roulette.
* Confetti or celebratory effect for especially chaotic instructions 🎡😄
