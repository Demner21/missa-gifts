### Final Ceremony Phase (Game Closure)

**Overview**

* After the Instructions Phase is completed, the application must enter a final phase called **“Final Ceremony”**.
* This phase serves as an **emotional and visual closure** to the game, focusing on celebration rather than data accuracy.

**Requirements**

* The Final Ceremony must present a **full-screen layout** with a festive and celebratory style.
* The screen must clearly indicate that the game has ended (e.g., *“🎁 The Christmas Raffle Has Ended”*).
* No further interactions that affect the game state are allowed in this phase.

**Content Display**

* The application must display a **ceremonial summary** that includes:

  * The list of participants.
  * The gift initially assigned to each participant.
  * The instruction received by each participant.
* The summary does **not need to reflect the final gift ownership** after instructions.

**Presentation & Animation**

* Participants must be revealed **one by one**, following the original draw order.
* Each reveal should include:

  * Participant name
  * Gift assigned during the raffle
  * Instruction received during the Instructions Phase
* Subtle animations (fade-in, slide, or scale) should be used to enhance the ceremonial feel.

**UX Considerations**

* The Final Ceremony layout must:

  * Hide all previous game controls and layouts.
  * Prevent navigation back to earlier phases unless explicitly allowed (e.g., “Restart Game”).
* A clear visual distinction must exist between:

  * Game phases (*Raffle*, *Instructions*, *Final Ceremony*).

**User Experience Goal**

* The Final Ceremony should feel like a **celebration and shared moment**, providing emotional closure rather than technical completeness.

**Optional Enhancements**

* Festive background or theme (Christmas-style).
* Light sound effects during participant reveals.
* A single action button such as **“Restart Game”** or **“Play Again”**.
