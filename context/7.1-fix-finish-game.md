### Final Ceremony – Christmas Celebration Effect

**Requirement**

* At the final moment of the **Final Ceremony**, the application must display a **Christmas-themed visual effect** to mark the end of the game.
* This effect should act as the **closing highlight** before or during the ceremonial summary reveal.

**Behavior**

* The Christmas effect should:

  * Trigger automatically once all participants have been revealed.
  * Run for a short, predefined duration.
  * Not require any user interaction to start.
* After the effect is shown, the application must:

  * Clearly indicate that the game has ended.
  * Display or keep visible the **Final Ceremonial Summary**.

**Visual Considerations**

* The effect should be festive but subtle, such as:

  * Falling snow
  * Confetti with Christmas colors
  * Soft glow or light animations
* The effect must not obstruct the readability of the ceremonial summary.

**UX Considerations**

* All game controls must be disabled during the effect.
* The transition into the effect should feel **smooth and celebratory**, not abrupt.
* The effect should reinforce the feeling of closure and celebration.

**User Experience Goal**

* End the game with a **memorable Christmas moment**, leaving players with a positive and festive impression.

**Optional Enhancements**

* Add a soft Christmas sound effect.
* Allow toggling the effect on/off for accessibility or performance reasons.
